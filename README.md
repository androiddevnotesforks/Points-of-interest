Points of interest
==================

**Gather and organize everything that matters**

This application allows users to easily receive and organize shared data, such as links, text, and images.
Create your points of interests easily with minimalistic interface:
- Use wizard to automatically parse link content
- Create your own custom categories
- Leave a message for yourself from future.
The app also allows for easy searching and filtering of stored information, making it easy to find the information you need quickly.

**Current version of application is offline only. It is a work in progress. So stay tuned for future updates.**

## Architecture
This application follows the classic SOLID based clean architecture approach. This approach differs from
[official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), Ð¸ut it is actively used by many developers.
With this approach, the amount of boilerplate code increases, in favor of standardization and scalability.

## Modularization
The Points of interests application follows modularization strategy know as **"by layer"**.
*Note*: For larger projects i would recommend using **by layer and by feature** strategy.
